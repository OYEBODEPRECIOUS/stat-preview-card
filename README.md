### Acknoledgements

I give glory to God almighty for giving me the priviledge to see this challenge online which was mentioned by Dillion Megida one of my mentors and also give kudos to OIC Hub and the tutors who taught me HTML and CSS. And also a wonderful applause to myself for completing this project in less than 1 hour.
